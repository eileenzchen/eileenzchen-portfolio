      <p className="subheading">problem</p>
      <p>
        We have all been in the ping pong situation of deciding where to eat, whether it is by ourselves, with a significant other, or with a group of friends. How can we create an efficient and effective for people to decide what to eat together?
      </p>
      <p className="subheading">solution</p>
      <p>
        I, along with two other engineers at CMU, designed and implemented What2Yum, an iOS app that enables friends, near or far, to make quick decisions of what to eat together. 
      </p>
      <p className="subheading">role</p>
      <p>
        I designed and implemented the user interaction, user flow, and visual 
        aesthetic.
      </p>
      <p className="subheading">growth</p>
      <p>
        Through this project, I learned the true meaning of the double diamond design model and how "going wide then narrow" applies to all phases of the product lifecycle. I also learned what draws users to mobile apps and how to leverage that to make a valuable, sustainable, and easy-to-use app.

Through interviewing six users who go out to eat at least once a week, we gathered that it is a pain for users to figure out what to eat, especially with a group of people with many opinions. For an individual, deciding what to eat can take up to 20 minutes. For a group, <b>deciding what to eat can take several days</b>. Some experience groupthink and are too afraid to voice their opinions. Others experience choice overload with factors such as cuisine, location, and price exacerbating the decision making process.

        Currently, people search across <b>Google, Yelp, and food delivery apps</b> to decide what to eat based on reviews and other filters like distance and price. However, these apps <b>do not allow for collaborative decision making</b>. There are also apps like Tiny Decisions that help people make decisions. However, these apps are often based on a <b>random</b> generator.

        Our competitive advantage is designing a <b>mobile app that makes deciding what to eat among a group collaborative and efficient</b>.

        To start off, we employed parallel design and independently sketched a couple paper prototypes with our initial features in mind. We wanted to quickly gain user feedback on multiple interactions and merge the good parts of the designs. The main interactions we wanted to test were filling out a preference questionnaire versus using a Tinder-like swiping mechanism to gather data on user food preferences.

      <p>
        After user testing, we gathered that users liked the fun interaction of swiping their preferences, but also wanted to be able to fill out a couple preferences like location and price. Thus, we essentially took the best of both worlds and merged our two user flows for our next iteration of lofi prototypes.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a meeting, we realized that the app can function in a synchronous (everyone has to be on the app at the same time to decide) versus asynchronous (people can input preferences at different times) way for a friend group. My team had differing opinions and thus we decided to settle our debate by testing these two flows on users. 
      </p>
      <ModalImage
        style={{marginTop: "30px", marginBottom: "30px"}}
        className="drop-shadow-hover-light"

        imageBackgroundColor="transparent"
        hideDownload={true}
        hideZoom={true}
      />
      <p>
        We simulated interactions such as a user waiting for five others to join during the synchronous experience. We furthermore sent out a user servey to collect data on user behavior when deciding what to eat with friends as well as their preferred experience.
      </p>
      <Grid container columns={2} style={{marginTop: "30px", marginBottom: "30px"}}>
        <Grid item xs={2} sm={1} className="align-right">

          </video>
        </Grid>
      </Grid>
      <p>
        From our user testing and user survey results, users predominantly preferred an asynchronous experience as it allowed for flexibility in when to decide. Users decide what to eat at different times, some deciding day of and some planning 2-3 days in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
        After figuring out how to collect preference data from users, we came across another challenge: How should our restaurant recommendation algorithm work? What if two restaurants are chosen the same amount of times? 
      </p>
      <p>
        We user tested with hifi prototypes. One design follows our original card swiping interaction and ranks the outcome based on factors such as distance and rating. The other design shows users two restaurants to choose from at a time and ultimately creates a top three ranked list of all of the users' rankings.
      </p>
      <div style={{marginTop: "30px"}}>
        <ModalImage
          className="drop-shadow-hover-light"
          style={{marginTop: "30px"}}
          small={Assets.HifiSwipeChoices}
          large={Assets.HifiSwipeChoices}
          alt="swiping preferences vs picking out of two choices"
          imageBackgroundColor="transparent"
          hideDownload={true}
          hideZoom={true}
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Ultimately, we evaluated the tradeoffs between a more interesting user experience with the swipes versus a better final recommendation with the ranked list. Since the recommendation was only marginally more absolute than the other, we decided to go with the swipe interaction. We wanted to create a more engaging user experience and have a pretty good recommendation model over a worse user experience and a better recommendation model.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally through user testing, I discovered that people want more explainable suggestions. They want to know why those particular restaurant suggestions were shown in that order. I thus added ranking factors such as the number of people in the group that voted for the particular restaurant and the distance from the user's chosen location. I also made a couple iterations of the suggestions page to improve clarity and readability. I grouped each restaurant into its own card and restructured the flow of information.

        For the final versions of our app, we continuously re-evaluated our development priorities as we built out different features based on user feedback, our timeline, and the techinical difficulty versus impact of the feature. I also designed the app logo, icon, and app store screenshots for launching our app in the Apple app store.
