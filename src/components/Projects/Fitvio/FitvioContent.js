        During the heights of COVID-19, people prioritized their health and were <b>finding ways to stay active while staying safe</b>. Many looked for gym alternatives while others looked for ways to get into exercising with minimal prior experience. <b>As someone intimiated by gyms and just starting to look for ways to stay active at home, this problem deeply mattered to me.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Fitvio was a startup</b> founded by my classmate with the vision of creating a cohesive platform to help <b>beginners and pros alike improve their fitness and share their personal journeys</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I joined as <b>Head of Design</b> at Fitvio to create a brand identity, build the design strategy for the fast moving startup, and lead the user research and UX design of the app.

        The goal of Fitvio was to provide easy access to <b>content from a diverse set of personal trainers and connection with a fitness community</b>.
      </p>
      <p>We sought to answer the question:</p>
      <blockquote>
        How can we empower people of all fitness levels to find workouts and trainers that work for them at the comfort of their home?

        With just a product mission, I knew that it was vital to first understand our users and their pain points. With a diverse team unfamiliar with the role of design, I wanted to <b>establish design as a critical function</b> for Fitvio and help the team understand and partake in it. Thus, I <b>rallied the team to conduct and sit in on user interviews</b> and then held workshops based on the insights to <b>create personas and customer journey maps together</b>. I advocated for everyone to think of design not as the visuals to make things look nice, but a way of problem solving.
      </p>
      <p>From our personas, we have Lisa who is a part-time Fitness Instructor on YouTube and seeks to connect with her viewers more intimately in order to help them.</p>
      <p>We also have Sam, a casual health nut who has been struggling to get into working out consistently and finding exercises that work for her, especially confined to the comforts of her home.</p>

                It's hard to find workouts that work for their own body and situation (e.g. location, equipment).

              <li>
                It's hard to stay motivated to work out.

        From this, we worked to identify Fitvio's <b>market differentiator</b>, which was having a platform for <b>both fitness enthusiasts and instructors</b> to grow and share in their fitness journey. We started with the fitness enthusiast journey. From here, I led brainstorming sessions to identify and <b>prioritize features</b> for Fitvio.

        As we were working towards an MVP, I thought that <b>first and foremost, the design strategy should start with acquiring customers</b>. With no customers, no one will be seeing the product.

I started with Sam's&mdash;our casual health nut's&mdash;experience.
      </p>
      <p>Sam can choose to start working out right away without even creating an account. To track her progress and engage with instructors though, she can create an account, answer a couple questions, and get a personalized list of workout videos in just a few minutes.</p>

        With a couple rounds of user testing, many users <b>did not identify with our current branding</b>. The cool colors and rigid logo font make it intimidating and unapproachable. Thus, our marketing strategist and I worked together to <b>rebrand and create a brand guide</b>.

            Especially with a startup, uncertainty and change are inevitable. I learned to be more <b>comfortable with pivoting and working with ambiguity</b>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Every person on the team I worked with had a different background, whether it was a someone with a couple years of industry software experience or a university student studying business and data analytics. I learned to <b>speak and pitch ideas with a common language and adapted my language to the person's background</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Being a one person design team, I had to <b>juggle many different hats</b>, even beyond design roles. From discussing the technical feasibility of my user authentication design to choosing colors for the Fitvio brand to analyzing the data of our user survey, I pushed myself to <b>continuously learn from my teammates and pick up new skills on the fly</b>.

          <li>
            Although a lot of what I like about design is being able to "perfect" something and continually improving it, at a startup, there's no luxury of time. I could not spend hours on the spacing of a button or images. I learned to <b>work fluidly and quickly to constantly deliver with the bigger picture and vision in mind</b>.
