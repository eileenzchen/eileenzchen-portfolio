        <b>Fitvio was a startup</b> founded by my classmate with the vision of creating a <b>cohesive platform to help people, whether beginners or pros, improve their fitness and document their personal journeys</b> via easy access to content from personal trainers and connection with a fitness community.
      </p>
      <p className="subheading">role</p>
      <p>
        I was brought on as <b>Head of Design and the sole designer</b>. My first time in this kind of design leadership role, I took on the challenge of <b>creating a brand, design strategy, and onboarding experience</b> for Fitvio from the ground up while staying aligned with the product goals.
      </p>
      <p className="subheading">growth</p>
      <p>
        Through this experience, I <b>expanded the breadth of my design capabilities and pushed myself to learn new skills</b> like brand design. I furthermore was able to <b>experience first hand how design and product strategy need to be interwoven to drive forward a common vision</b>.

        As the only thing we had was an idea so far, I knew that it was vital to first understand our users. And not just for me to understand our users, but for the whole team from our engineer to the data analyst to the cofounders. From the get-go, I wanted to <b>establish design as a critical function for Fitvio and one that the whole team should understand and partake in</b>. I demonstrated that design was not there to make things look pretty, but to advocate for Fitvio's users and create experiences that are both usable and beautiful. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We needed to identify where their pain points lie and how Fitvio could position itself to help them in a way other apps do not already. <b>I led the efforts to interview users, collect insights, and hold workshops with the entire team to create personas and customer journey maps</b>.

        From this, we worked to identify Fitvio's <b>market differentiator</b>, which was having an all-in-one platform for both fitness enthusiasts and instructors to grow and share in their fitness journey. From here, I led brainstorming sessions to identify and <b>prioritize features</b> for Fitvio, <b>encouraging the team to think with the customer in mind first</b>.

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I viewed the role of design as one that should be incorporated in every step of the process</b> and one where I make sure everyone else on the team also understands our product from a human point of view.

        As we were working towards an MVP, I thought that <b>first and foremost the design strategy should be to acquire customers</b>. With no customers, no one will be seeing the product. With just an initial outsourced logo to work off of that was handed to me by one of the cofounders, I built an <b>onboarding experience for new users, starting from the Fitvio marketing page all the way to the authenticated home page</b>.

        With only the logo, our brand identity was severely lacking. The marketing strategist and I were asked by the co-founders to create a brand guide to improve this. <b>Although I've never designed a brand guide before or worked on branding, I was pretty excited to get my hands dirty and learn about it</b>. I quickly searched different brand guides like Peleton's and Uber's for inspiration and understanding of what they entailed. I created a color palette, logos and their usages, and font styles. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the pure design, I wanted to <b>extend the brand to all parts of Fitvio</b>, including the team itself. As we were working completely virtually, it was hard to build a team culture of connection and engagement. I uploaded our new logo as a Slack emoji to <b>socialize the new brand with the team and build excitement</b>.

            Especially with a startup, uncertainty and change are inevitable. I learned to be more <b>comfortable with pivoting and working with ambiguity</b>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Every person on the team I worked with had a different background, whether it was a someone with a couple years of industry software experience or a university student studying business and data analytics. I learned to <b>speak and pitch ideas with a common language and adapted my language to the person's background</b>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Being a one person design team, I had to <b>juggle many different hats</b>, even beyond design roles. From discussing the technical feasibility of my user authentication design to choosing colors for the Fitvio brand to analyzing the data of our user survey, I pushed myself to <b>continuously learn from my teammates and pick up new skills on the fly</b>.

          <li>
            Although a lot of what I like about design is being able to "perfect" something and continually improving it, at a startup, there's no luxury of time. I could not spend hours on the spacing of a button or images. I learned to <b>work fluidly and quickly to constantly deliver with the bigger picture and vision in mind</b>.
